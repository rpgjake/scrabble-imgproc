ECE 6258 Project
Stephen Wilkins & Jake Ramey

To run this project, simply run Scrabble.py. No arguments are needed.
This project requires that Tesseract be installed and pytesseract also be installed and hooked into the correct directory.
An English training data file is also required to run Tesseract using the letters.

There are lines in Scrabble.py that are specific to my Windows installation directories. If Tesseract is installed
with the defaults, there should be little difference in those lines for another machine. The code has not been tested
on any other OS other than Windows 10.
